# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## What I learnt:
- Creating a list
- Randomizing options from a list
- Getting user input
- Checking single character inputs
- Creating an understandle interfect in the terminal to allow the user to play the game
- Debugging code where minor errors had occurred
- Commenting the code for easier understanding
- Appropriate function names
- Committing changes to github
