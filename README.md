# Hangman
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python. It allows users to guess letters of a randomly selected word from a predefined list, aiming to figure out the word before running out of lives.

## Features

- **Random word selection:** The game randomly picks a word from a list, making each game a unique challenge.
- **Limited attempts:** Players have a limited number of lives to guess the word correctly.
- **Input validation:** Ensures that the input is a single letter and handles repeated letters.
- **Interactive gameplay:** Players interact with the game through the console, receiving immediate feedback on their guesses.

## How to Play

1. **Start the game:** Run the script to begin.
2. **Guess letters:** Enter one letter at a time to try to reveal the hidden word.
3. **Win or lose:** The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

No additional libraries are required to run this game. You can clone this repository and run the game in your Python environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajayb06/hangman.git
cd ../hangman
python hangman.py
```

## What I learnt:

- Creating a list
- Randomizing options from a list
- Getting user input
- Checking single character inputs
- Creating an understandle interfect in the terminal to allow the user to play the game
- Debugging code where minor errors had occurred
- Commenting the code for easier understanding
- Appropriate function names
- Committing changes to github
